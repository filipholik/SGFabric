SSH setup 
On H1, generate an SSH key (if you don’t already have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "switch_test" -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

This creates:
~/.ssh/id_ed25519         # private key
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub     # public key

Copy the public key to H2, run:
ssh-copy-id user2@10.0.0.2

Then type your password once — it will install the key into:
/home/user2/.ssh/authorized_keys

Test it, try:
ssh user2@10.0.0.2
